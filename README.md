# php-test-inventory-system

A sample application to show off my coding skills. I used my time to focus on functionality and debugging, so the aesthetic design is basic.

Developed in Eclipse using the php 7.1 built-in server and MySQL.

To access the php server, open a cmd prompt to the project directory and enter "php -S localhost:8000".

I used a very simple schema of one table to store the garments. I did not include any log-in tables since this was just a demo. The sql to create the table, as well as seed test data, can be found in the file "master/database create and seed.sql".
